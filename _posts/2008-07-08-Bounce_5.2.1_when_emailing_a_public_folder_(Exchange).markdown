title: Bounce 5.2.1 when emailing a public folder (Exchange)
---

\_\_NOTOC\_\_

### Symptom

When emailing a mail-enabled public folder on Exchange the email can
bounce and a NDR (Non Delivery Report) is issued with the following
text:

    The message reached the recipient's e-mail system, but delivery was refused. Attempt to resend the message. If it still fails, contact your system administrator.
    <exchangeserver.domain #5.2.1>

### Cause

A possible cause is permissions: Anonymous requires \'Author rights\' on
the public folder; without this external users will not be able to
\'create\' the email in the public folder. If an attachment is over the
specificed limit this NDR could also be generated.

### Resolution

To check the permissions:

1.  Open
    \[<http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa995785(EXCHG.65>).aspx
    Exchange System Manager\]: Go to Start \> Programs \> Microsoft
    Exchange \> System Manager.
2.  Expand **Folders**, **Public Folders** and right click the public
    folder that has the issue and click **Properties**.
3.  Click on the **Permissions** tab and then **Client permissions**.
4.  Ensure that \'Anonymous\' is listed and has \'Author\' permissions
    or add it if it is not present.
