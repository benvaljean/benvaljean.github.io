### ILOM

Access config from within bios under Advanced \> IPMI

By default the Linux root password can be used in the ILOM

Set system name: System Information \> Identification Information

Usage is via \'cding\' to various components. /SP is \'service
processor\' - aka the ilom itself. /SYS is the server itself.

#### Check for POST faults

    show /SYS/faultmgmt -level all

Or:

    -> show /SYS_name = /SYS
     /SYS  
    ........
        Properties:nsole
            type = Host Systemtart /SP/console (y/n)? y
            ipmi_name = /SYS
            product_name = SUN FIRE X4270 M2 SERVER
            product_part_number = 30056980+1+1
            product_serial_number = 1137FMM0DG
            product_manufacturer = ORACLE CORPORATION
            fault_state = OK
            clear_fault_action = (none)
            power_state = On

#### Power cycle system

-   Graceful:

<!-- -->

    stop /SYS
    start /SYS

-   Ungraceful:

<!-- -->

    start -script /SYS
    stop -script /SYS

#### Serial console output

Useful for verifying that server is coning up.

    start /SP/console
