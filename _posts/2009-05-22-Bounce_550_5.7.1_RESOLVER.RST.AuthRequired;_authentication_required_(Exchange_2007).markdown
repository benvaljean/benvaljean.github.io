title: Bounce 550 5.7.1 RESOLVER.RST.AuthRequired; authentication required (Exchange 2007)
---

### Symptom

When sending an email to a distribution list on Exchange 2007 from an
external sender the following bounce is received, or viewable in the
SMTP/Hub Transport log:

    550 5.7.1 RESOLVER.RST.AuthRequired; authentication required

### Cause

By default Exchange 2007 requires that a sender be authenticated before
being able to successfully send to a distribution list. Consequently
external users are unable to send emails to it.

### Resolution

-   From the properties of the distribution list in Exchange AD:
    **Exchange General** tab, Un-tick **From authenticated users only**

<!-- -->

-   From the properties of the distribution list in [Exchange Management
    Console](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb123762.aspx):
    **Mail-flow settings** tab, Message Delivery Restrictions, un-tick
    **Require that all senders are authenticated**.
