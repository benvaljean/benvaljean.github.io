\'\'Motor sport and animal lover in his mid-twenties who only recently
learnt to drive and does not have any pets. \'\'

I like tennis, flying and west-end (London) theatre. I used to play a
lot of tennis but I find that I prefer flying planes and if I had more
spare cash I would start lessons for my PPL. It would be easier to list
the shows in the west-end that I *have not* seen; rising prices result
in my attending a lot less nowadays. Phantom is great but in my opinion
not worth Â£75 per seat.

This site was started in 2007 when it was under a different domain and
was hosted on an IBM laptop. It became clear that a web-based
documentation tool would be very useful for my day-to-day work. Nowadays
I document most of the work I do although sadly 75% of it never makes it
onto here as I do not have time to re-write it from my own awful version
of shorthand to something that other people would understand.

Originally this site was called Rogerrabbit.net and was only a personal
site, I put it online and its links found their way onto other websites
and it slowly became an established website, although I am - to a degree
- subjective. With \~1700 unique users per month (audited to remove
bots) it has come a long way from an IBM laptop sitting under my desk.

Comments or suggestions - please get in touch. I would love to hear from
you. <http://ben.goodacre.name/contact>
