A404 and the A404(M), between Maidenhead and High Wycombe. Quite fast,
corners, hills and roundabouts, where you change down listening to the
nice sound if the ol\' engine revving high :)

Milton Keynes A43 The stretch from Duddington to Corby was pretty good
with nice fast bends and hills etc.

A52 Nottingham -\> Boston : good fun, some nice wide open bends with
miles of visibility, raised from the surround flooding plains.
