title: Bounce 550 5.7.1 RESOLVER.RST.AuthRequired; authentication required (Exchange 2007)
---

### Symptom

When sending an email to a distribution list on Exchange 2007 from an
external sender the following bounce is received, or viewable in the
SMTP/Hub Transport log:

    550 5.7.1 RESOLVER.RST.AuthRequired; authentication required

### Cause

The external recipient expectedly as no AD permissions and consequently
does not have the necessary permissions to send an email to the
distribution list.

### Resolution

From the properties of the distribution list in Exchange AD: **Exchange
General** tab, Un-tick **From authenticated users only**

From the properties of the distribution list in [Exchange Management
Console](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb123762.aspx):
**Mail-flow settings** tab, Message Delivery Restrictions, un-tick
**Require that all senders are authenticated**.
