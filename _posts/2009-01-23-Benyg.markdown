Motor sport and animal lover in his mid-twenties who only recently
learnt to drive and does not have any pets.

I started Rogerrabbit.net further to being so bored in a previous job
that I actually wrote documentation without being told to do it. Now I
am almost born-again - I document most of the work I do although sadly
90% of it never makes it onto here as I do not have time to re-write it
from my own awful version of shorthand to something that other people
would understand.

Yes, the domain makes no sense. Originally Rogerrabbit.net was only a
personal site, I put it online and its links found their way onto other
websites and it slowly because a \'proper\' website, with \~2000 unique
hits per month nowadays. - Initially Rogerrabbit.net was served from an
IBM laptop sitting at my feet next to my PC! the plan is to turn
www.rogerrabbit.net/wiki into something more appropriate like
ben.goodacre.name/tech but like everything else I do not have the time.
