title: Why was this site called Rogerrabbit.net?

*\"Why is this website called Rogerrabbit.net when it does not relate to
Roger Rabbit apart from a few stupid pictures?\"* \-- Chris, November
2008

This site is no longer called Rogerrabbit.net as the domain appeared
nonsensical. Originally this site was called Rogerrabbit.net and was
only a personal site, I put it online and its links found their way onto
other websites and it slowly became an established website, even though
I do say so myself. :) With \~1700 unique users per month (audited to
remove bots) it has come a long way from an IBM laptop sitting under my
desk.
