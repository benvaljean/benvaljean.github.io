I like photography, speaking Mandarin and west-end (London) theatre. I
used to play a lot of tennis but nowadays I prefer photography
infinitely. When I am not shooting I am usually (trying) to speak
Mandarin or playing around with aomething Linux-related. To see my
pictures: <http://www.goodacrephotography.co.uk> or my flickr

This site was started in 2007 when it was under a different domain and
was hosted on an IBM laptop. It became clear that a web-based
documentation tool would be very useful for my day-to-day work. Nowadays
I document most of the work I do although sadly 75% of it never makes it
onto here as I do not have time to re-write it from my own awful version
of shorthand to something that everybody else would understand.

Originally this site was called Rogerrabbit.net and was only a personal
site, I put it online and its links found their way onto other websites
and it slowly became an established website. With 3000+ unique users per
month (audited to remove bots) it has come a long way from an IBM laptop
sitting under my desk.

I work for an ISP as a Linux Systems Administrator, based NW of London,
UK.

Comments or suggestions - please get in touch. I would love to hear from
you. <http://ben.goodacre.name/contact>
