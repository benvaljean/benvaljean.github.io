        <p>Hello, my name is Benjamin. 我叫本杰明. Anh là Benjamin</p>
        <p>I am a Senior/Lead Devops Engineer, coming from a sysadmin background having started working in the industry in 2003. Repeatable builds of platforms and applications is important - being expected to do more with less time has been the keystone of the industry in the last 10 years or more. I enjoy photography and sometimes I even get paid for my hobby, I have taken pictures in 3 continents and excluding the pictures of myself of course all the pictures you see here were taken by me. There is always something interesting about anything, it just has to be found. This is what I enjoy doing when shooting pictures and working with technology.</p>

                 <h2>Devops before devops was invented</h2>    
                 <p>Since before Devops was a concept I have always been interested in Developer practices and encouraged Operations engaging with Devs as well as enjoying working Devs. When I first started using Chef the idea of being able to do a commit and treat infrastructure-as-code and leverage the benefits was very interesting.</p>

            <h2>The single most important component of a camera...</h2>
            <p>...is the twelve inches behind it! <span class="text-secondary">― Ansel Adams.</span>  My first photos I took were with a 110 film camera in the early 90s, since then I have moved onto many different cameras but my passion for getting a shot done right has never changed. I enjoy the process of making a photo instead of just taking it. As you can see from the pictures you see here, I enjoy shooting a mixture of landscape and portrait in many different styles. I love capturing a great expression in a single moment that can now be conveyed in a picture for a lifetime.</p>

        <h2>我会中文但不能说得流利</h2>
        <p>I worked in China in the early 2010s and enjoyed it a lot. I like the architecture and the people. Learning Chinese was also great fun, although it is a bit rusty nowadays. There are lots of great places to explore in the country, Beihai Park in Beijing and Green Lake park in Kunming are among my favourites.</p>

        <h2>Anh đã từng sống ở Việt Nam.</h2>
        <p>I worked in Vietnam in late 2010s/early 2020s and enjoyed both the metropolitan/city style of life with coffee shops and cocktail bars, as well as well as doing motorbike trips across Vietnam. - I experienced both ends of the spectrum. :) Saigon is a nice place with lots of great places to explore. The plentiful coffee shops are often independent and not part of a chain - each have their own style. There are also lots of live music cafes with nominal cover charges.</p>
