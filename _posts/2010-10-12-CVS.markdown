#### Create new project in an existing repo

-   Ensure you CVSROOT variable is set or use the `-d` parameter to set
    it.

<!-- -->

    mkdir new-project
    cd new-project
    cvs import new-project alternative-name v1

-   Enter a description in the Vim window that appears and exit and the
    project will have been created.

#### Add new dir to repo

    cd peroject/
    mkdir new-folder
    cvs add new-folder

#### Files

Add a new file:

    cvs add filename

Remove file from the repo, but keep prevision versions:

    rm file
    cvs remove file
    cvs commit

Reverse/undo a commit, if current version is 1.1 and the prevision
version is 1.0:

    cvs update -j 1.1 -j 1.0 file
    cvs commit file
