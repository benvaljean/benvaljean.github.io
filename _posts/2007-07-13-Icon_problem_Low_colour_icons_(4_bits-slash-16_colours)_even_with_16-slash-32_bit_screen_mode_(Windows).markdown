### Symptoms

All icons - including your desktop, file and start menu icons - have a
low number of colours and consequently do not have the same \'quality\'
as they previously did, even in a screen mode of 16 or 32 bits (65,000+
colours.) A typicial example of this is shown to the right with 4 bit/16
colour desktop icons in front of a 16 bit/65k colour image.
