*\"Why is this website called Rogerrabbit.net when it does not relate to
Roger Rabbit apart from a few stupid pictures?\"* \-- Chris, November
2008

Yes, the domain makes no sense. Originally Rogerrabbit.net was only a
personal site, I put it online and its links found their way onto other
websites and it slowly because a \'proper\' website, with \~2000 unique
hits per month nowadays. Initially Rogerrabbit.net was served from an
IBM laptop sitting at my feet next to my PC. the plan is to turn
www.rogerrabbit.net/wiki into something more appropriate like
ben.goodacre.name/tech but like everything else I do not have the time.
