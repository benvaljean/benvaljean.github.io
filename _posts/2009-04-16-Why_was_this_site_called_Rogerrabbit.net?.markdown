*\"Why is this website called Rogerrabbit.net when it does not relate to
Roger Rabbit apart from a few stupid pictures?\"* \-- Chris, November

Yes, the domain makes no sense. Originally Rogerrabbit.net was only a
personal site, I put it online and its links found their way onto other
websites and it slowly because a \'proper\' website, with \~2000 unique
hits per month nowadays. I am now in a scenario where I am concerned I
would loose Google-rankings should I change the domain. If anyone has
any expert-information or experience on this or has any other
suggestions please [contact
